\begin{frame}{Problem Statement}{When LED have dual function of Illumination and Data Transmission}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone who does not follow everything on the slide itself.

			    \textbf{How to achieve data transmission without effecting brightness level of LED lights?}
			  \item
       			   Data is transmitted by unexpected variations in signal
			  \item
       			   These variations change signal DC average, brightness level
			  \end{itemize}
